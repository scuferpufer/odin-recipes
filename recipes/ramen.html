    <h3 class="ingredient">Ingredients</h3>
    <br />

    <ul class="repo">
      <li>Thin Noodles</li>
      <li>1/2 pound boneless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup of water</li>
      <li>4 cups of low sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 jalapeno pepper, sliced</li>
      <li>1/2 of mushrooms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="step">Steps</h3>

    <ol class="repa">
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add
        chicken thighs and cook until golden, about 2-3 minutes per side; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken broth, 1 cup water, mushrooms, Sriracha and chicken
        thighs; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked
        through, about 10-13 minutes. Remove chicken thighs from the pot and
        shred the chicken before returning to the pot; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in noodles and cook until tender, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Place eggs in a large saucepan and cover with cold water by 1 inch.
        Bring to a boil and cook for 1 minute. Cover eggs with a tight-fitting
        lid and remove from heat; set aside for 8-10 minutes. Drain well and let
        cool before peeling and halving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve noodles immediately, garnished with eggs, jalapeno and green
        onion, if desired.
      </li>
