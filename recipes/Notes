Notes

*This is notes for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I will be adding more as I learn more.

/* divs and spans give no particular meaning to their content. They are just generic boxes that can contain anything. */
/* <a> is a perfect example of an inline element. */
/* Don't put extra padding or margin on inline elemets. */

/* Div are block level elements by default. */
/* They are used to group elements together. */

/* Spans are inline elements by default. */
/* They are used to group elements together. */
/* They are used to style a specific part of a text and should only be used when no other semantic HTML element is appropriate. */

/* Inline Inline elements behave differently. 
They don't appear on new lines; instead, 
they all sit on the same line along with any adjacent (or wrapped) 
text content as long as there is space for them to do so inside the width of the parent block level element.
If there isn't space, then the overflowing content will move down to a new line */

/*A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element*/
/*A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).*/

The <div> element is often used as a block container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

<p> and <div> are block elements by default.
<a> and <span> are inline elements by default.

List that are block elements by default:
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<blockquote>
<canvas>
<dd>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>
<fieldset>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>

<li>
<main>
<nav>

/*Flexbox is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers. */
Flex in shorthand is flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
