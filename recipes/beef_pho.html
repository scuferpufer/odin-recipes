  <li>1 tablespoon salt, divided</li>
  <li>2 gallons of water</li>
  <li>2 medium onions, quartered</li>
  <li>1 (4inch) piece fresh ginger root</li>
  <li>2 pounds beef oxtail</li>
  <li>1 white (daikon) radish, sliced</li>
  <li>2 ounces whole star anise pods</li>
  <li>1/2 (3 inch) cinnamon stick</li>
  <li>2 whole cloves</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place beef bones in a 9-quart (or larger) pot; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Pour water into the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer broth for about 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a 10x15-inch roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
  <li>Place onions and ginger on the prepared pan. Cook under the preheated broiler until onions and ginger are blackened on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn onions once while cooking. Remove from oven and rinse under cold water until cool enough to handle. Remove and discard charred onion skins; cut charred ginger into slices.</li>
  <li>Strain broth. Discard bone and bouquet garni. Reserve meat from bones for another use. Chill broth in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
  <li>Skim and discard fat from the top of chilled broth. Pour broth into a pot; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and keep hot until ready to serve</li>
  <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Turn off heat. Stir in rice noodles and let sit until noodles are tender yet chewy, 6 to 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Drain and divide noodles among bowls, about 1 1/2 cups per serving. Top each with a few sirloin slices. Ladle hot broth over sirloin and noodles</li>
</ol>
